#what kind of directory structure to expect? 
#For a directory structure like /archive/am5/am5/am5f3b1r0/c96L65_am5f3b1r0_pdclim1850F/gfdl.ncrc5-deploy-prod-openmp/pp
# the output_path_template is set as follows.
#We have NA in those values that do not match up with any of the expected headerlist (CSV columns), otherwise we
#simply specify the associated header name in the appropriate place. E.g. The third directory in the PP path example
#above is the model (source_id), so the third list value in output_path_template is set to 'source_id'. We make sure
#this is a valid value in headerlist as well.
#The fourth directory is am5f3b1r0 which does not map to an existing header value. So we simply NA in output_path_template
#for the fourth value.

#catalog headers
#The headerlist is expected column names in your catalog/csv file. This is usually determined by the users in conjuction
#with the ESM collection specification standards and the appropriate workflows.
